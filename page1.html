                <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                <p>The core concept of synthetic biology is the intentional design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, as well as the redesign of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. This involves applying engineering principles to biology, allowing scientists to standardize and modularize biological components much like electronic parts. By manipulating genetic information and cellular machinery, synthetic biology aims to create organisms with novel functions, such as bacteria that produce biofuels, yeast that synthesize pharmaceuticals, or plants that can detect environmental toxins, thereby opening new possibilities in medicine, industry, and environmental sustainability.

                <h3>Gene Therapy</h3>
                <p>Gene therapy is a promising approach in healthcare that aims to treat genetic disorders by introducing healthy genes into a patient's cells. This involves using vectors, such as viruses, to deliver the therapeutic genes to target cells, where they can replace or supplement faulty genes. Gene therapy holds potential for treating a wide range of diseases, from inherited disorders like cystic fibrosis to cancers and cardiovascular conditions.
